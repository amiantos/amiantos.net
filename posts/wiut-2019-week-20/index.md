I feel like I took it pretty easy this week, productivity wise.

After writing the "What I'm Up To" for last week, I realized I wasn't particularly happy with the way this blog looked, so I spent some time over the week sprucing it up a bit. Here's a side-by-side before and after picture...

Some changes are more noticable on bigger screens, becaue I reduced the font size of blog posts by quite a bit. Other changes are more obvious, like the greatly reduced shadowing, reduced corner radius on blocks, and rearranging blog metadata to be a bit more pleasing to the eye.

The stars of the show are the new blocks promoting my open source projects. I've been conflicted thinking I should treat *amiantos.net* as my blog and *bradroot.me* as my portfolio, but I figured since this blog is where most people will land to ingest my stuff, I should probably consolidate everything onto here. Updating my about box and adding these product boxes was step one on that journey. The code itself is still a mess and needs refactoring, but it's a good first draft. Eventually I'll put these underneath the about box on every blog post, just to be thorough.

Along the way I removed all the photo posts (this is meant to be a blog and not a photolog) and ended up removing the little 'menu' at the top of the screen since I figured it was pretty much useless.
