Hi! Welcome, this is my weekly post where I talk about what I did over the course of the week.

## Life Saver

I released [Life Saver v1.1](/lifesaver) this weekend. It's a relatively small update that contains a lot of the work [I mentioned previously](/tags/lifesaver) on this blog: SpriteKit optimizations for performance gains, as well as a couple small bug fixes, and one new feature. The new feature is "random color preset" mode, where each time the screensaver launches, a new color preset is picked at random. I decided I'd like this feature for myself, so I added it in!

I also began work on an tvOS version of Life Saver. I figure there are plenty of "fireplace" apps on the App Store, why not the same sort of thing but more abstract and configurable? Besides, it'll be a nice simple project (hopefully) to put some real tvOS UI experience under my belt.

I don't have anything to show here yet, but I will say I'm conflicted between programmatic UI or using storyboards for this project. I've already implemented some basic UI programmatically, and after dealing with it with Aeon Garden, I'm not sure I care enough to keep going this route. I wish I could use SwiftUI already, but I don't really want to wait a couple months to start to work on this.

## The Future

I started thinking this weekend about more projects. This is still kind of ridiculous, as I have Numu Tracker and Aeon Garden to work on, but there's been an idea gnawing at me for years and maybe I'm finally ready to try to tackle it. I don't have much to say otherwise, I'll figure out how to post about it in the future, especially as I start to put real work into it.

That was it for me this week. I'll see you next week!
